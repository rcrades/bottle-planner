# Setting Up OpenAI Integration

This project uses OpenAI's API for generating intelligent baby feeding schedules based on your settings and preferences.

## Getting an API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (it will only be shown once)

## Adding Your API Key to the Project

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project
2. Add the following line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file

## Testing the Integration

You can test if your OpenAI integration is working correctly by running:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/test-openai.ts
```

If successful, you'll see a sample feeding schedule generated by the AI.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Make sure your API key is correct and has not expired
- **Billing Setup**: Ensure your OpenAI account has billing set up
- **Rate Limits**: Check if you've hit rate limits on your API key
- **Environment Variables**: Verify that your `.env` file is in the correct location

## Usage in the App

The AI integration is used in the "Plan Next 10 Feeds" feature in the Dashboard. If the OpenAI API fails for any reason, the app will fall back to a rule-based approach to generate a feeding schedule.
