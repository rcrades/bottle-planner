## Component Organization

### Component Directory Structure
- All components should be placed in the `src/components` directory
- UI components from shadcn/ui should be in `src/components/ui`
- Custom components should be in `src/components/[feature]` or directly in `src/components` if they're shared
- Pages should be in `src/pages`

### Component Import Rules
- Always use the `@` alias for imports, which points to the project root
- For components, use: `import { Component } from "@/components/ui/..."`
- For pages, use: `import { Page } from "@/pages/..."`
- For utils, use: `import { util } from "@/utils/..."`

### shadcn/ui Component Installation
- When installing new shadcn/ui components:
  1. Use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
  2. After installation, move the component from `/components/ui` to `src/components/ui`
  3. Update imports to use `@/components/ui/[component]`
  4. Update the README.md with the new component

### Example Component Structure
```
src/
  components/
    ui/              # shadcn/ui components
      button.tsx
      card.tsx
      alert.tsx
    feeding/         # feature-specific components
      FeedingCard.tsx
      FeedingList.tsx
    shared/          # shared components
      Layout.tsx
      Header.tsx
  pages/             # page components
    Dashboard.tsx
    Settings.tsx
```

## Package Management
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- Install dependencies with `pnpm add`
- Install dev dependencies with `pnpm add -D`
- Run scripts with `pnpm run [script]`
